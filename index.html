  <h3>Week One</h3>
  <p>My first week here I was tasked with learning on following things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Terminal</li>
    <li>Git</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After I'd learnt this I was asked to start learning React, but it became clear I needed some more experience 
    before tackling that.
    Esslam kindly gave me access to a website he subscribes to with a vast amount of content for me to digest.
    I started an Introduction to Web Development course which contained around 11 hours of content to consume. 
    Going through the basics in topics such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, Node.js, NPM, Express, Git, and the command line.
    <br>
    <br>
    It is my intention to show elements of what i've learnt in this website.
